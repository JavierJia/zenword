# Zenword Web Game

**A Relaxing Word Puzzle Experience in Your Browser**

## Overview

Zenword is a web-based word puzzle game where players connect letter tiles to form words. The game is designed to be a relaxing and mentally stimulating experience, featuring a minimalist aesthetic, calming audio, and progressively challenging puzzles, all accessible directly in your web browser.

## Core Features

*   **Intuitive Word Formation:** Players swipe their mouse or finger across letter tiles to create words.
*   **Dynamic Grid Puzzles:** Each level presents a unique grid of letters with hidden words to discover.
*   **Progressive Difficulty:** The game gradually increases in difficulty, introducing larger grids, longer words, and more complex word placements.
*   **Zen Aesthetic:** Clean, minimalist visuals and relaxing audio contribute to a calm and focused gameplay experience.
*   **Level Progression:** Players unlock new levels by completing existing ones.
*   **Scoring System:** Points are awarded based on word length, difficulty, and speed.
*   **Bonus Words:** Finding hidden words within the grid, that are not part of the answer, provide bonus points.
*   **Hint System:** Players can use hints to reveal letters or shuffle the grid when stuck.
* **Browser Based:** No downloading or installation, just load the webpage.

## Game Mechanics

### Grid Generation

*   **Grid Size:** Initially, grids will be 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5. Future development may include variable grid sizes.
*   **Word Placement:** Words are placed horizontally, vertically, and potentially diagonally within the grid.
*   **Word List:** A pre-compiled database of words (likely loaded as a JSON file) will be used. This list may be expanded to include multiple languages in the future.
*   **Difficulty Scaling:** Difficulty will scale through:
    *   Increasing grid size.
    *   Introducing longer words.
    *   Increasing the number of words per puzzle.
    *   More complex word placement.
    *   Shorter time limit.

### Word Recognition

*   **Input Handling:** The game will accurately interpret the player's mouse or touch interactions to track their swipe path across the letter tiles.
*   **Word Validation:** A word list (potentially optimized with a Trie data structure implemented in JavaScript) will be used to validate player-formed words.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Correct words will be highlighted with a visual cue (e.g., color change, animation).

### Gameplay Loop

*   **Level Unlock:** Levels are unlocked sequentially upon completion of the previous level.
*   **Scoring:**
    *   Word Length: Longer words earn more points.
    *   Difficulty: More obscure words may be worth more points.
    *   Speed: Completing the puzzle quickly may result in bonus points.
    * Bonus words will increase the score.
*   **Hints:**
    *   Hints can reveal a single letter in a word.
    *   Hints can shuffle the grid, potentially providing new connections.
    *   Hints may be earned or used as in game currency.
*   **Game Over:** Currently, there is no game over condition. Future development may include time limits.
